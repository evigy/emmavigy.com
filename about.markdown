# <u>Bio</u>

My name is Emma Vigy and I am a software engineer that graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in computer science. Originally, I emigrated from France, and in my time in university I solidifed my passion for programming. When I am not working or hacking together personal projects, I enjoy spending time with family, reading, running, skiing, and lifting weights. I one day aspire to be a [six star finisher](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/six-star).
