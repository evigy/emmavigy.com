# <u>Bio</u>

My name is Emma Vigy and I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Originally, I emigrated from France, and during my time at university I solidifed my passion for programming, which still grows more and more everyday.

University life has been quite the learning experience, and it's during these years that I've truly come to understand what makes my heart race: programming. There's something enchanting about weaving lines of code together, crafting algorithms like puzzles, and watching them come to life. It's safe to say that my passion for programming has gone from a spark to a full-blown fire, all thanks to my time at university.

   Now, while I thrive on problem-solving and creating in the digital realm, I've also got a vibrant life outside of the screen. Family means the world to me, and there's nothing like the warmth of those connections. When I'm not immersed in code or working on personal projects, you might just catch me with my nose buried in a good book, hitting the pavement on a run, gliding down snow-covered slopes on skis, or pushing my limits in the gym with some heavy lifting.

  It's a diverse mix, I know! But that's what life is all about – embracing every facet and experiencing all the colors it has to offer. So, whether I'm crafting lines of code or crafting unforgettable memories, I'm navigating the exciting convergence of technology, academia, and the simple joys of life.
